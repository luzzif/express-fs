# How to contribute

## Commit Message Format

Each commit message consists of a header and an optional body, separated by an empty line.

Header format: [type][jira-key]: subject.

type must have one of the following values:

feat: a new feature
fix: a bug fix
docs: documentation only changes
style: changes that do not affect the meaning of the code (white-space, formatting, missing semi-colons, etc)
refactor: a code change that neither fixes a bug nor adds a feature
perf: a code change that improves performance
test: adding missing tests
chore: changes to the build process or auxiliary tools and libraries such as documentation generation
jira-key is optional.

subject is a succinct description of the change and:

uses the imperative, present tense: "change" not "changed" nor "changes"
doesn't capitalize the first letter
has no dot (.) at the end
Body

Just as in the subject, use the imperative, present tense: "change" not "changed" nor "changes". The body should include the motivation for the change and contrast this with previous behavior.

## Example:

```
[chore][DOC-1]: dev environment setup

Add linter, add base dependencies.
```
